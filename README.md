This site has been designed and built in HTML, SCSS and JavaScript, using the Tesco website for reference. 

For demonstration purposes, it has a functional shopping cart, built with vanilla JavaScript. The theme is aimed at websites with e-commerce capabilities, but is also suitable for website without such functionalities. With a mobile-first responsive design, this design is clean and easy to navigate on desktop, tablet and mobile viewports.

For this project, I delved into SCSS which I quite enjoyed using for its simplicity. I also became more familiar with local storage, which I use to display shopping cart information. This was particularly useful for my day job, as it helped me to create a currency exchange widget in the booking engine. 

I intend to recreate this website in React in the near future.
